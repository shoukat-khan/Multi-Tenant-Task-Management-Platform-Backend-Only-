# Django Backend Setup for Team Management

This module covers the backend setup for a Django project focused on team management, using PostgreSQL as the database.

## Tasks

- Create Django project and backend app
- Set up PostgreSQL connection
- Define models:
  - User (using AbstractUser or a custom User model)
  - Team
- Create and run migrations
- Register models in Django Admin
- Set up Django REST Framework (DRF):
  - Serializers
  - ViewSets
  - Routers
- Build APIs for Team:
  - Create Team
  - List all Teams
  - Get Team by ID

## Notes
- The focus is on backend functionality only (no frontend).
- PostgreSQL will be used as the database backend.
- DRF will be used to expose RESTful APIs for the Team model.
- User authentication will use Django's AbstractUser or a custom user model as needed.
